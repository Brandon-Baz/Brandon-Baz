## ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact
My path to becoming a Software Engineer was not orthodox. After my military discharge in 2012, I spent five years in Store Management and Small Business Acquisitions with AT&T. I started self-teaching programming in 2017 and fully committed to my career in tech in 2021. I secured my first full-time role at Wolfjaw Studios in November 2022.
